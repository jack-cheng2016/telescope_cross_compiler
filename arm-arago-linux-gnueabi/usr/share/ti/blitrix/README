Blitrix Demos
-------------

We have included the two binary only versions of the Neon Blitrix Demo
	1. stand-alone
	2. Qt based

Running the Demos
-----------------

1. Run the Blitrix stand-alone demo with the following command:
	$ bxdemo -i

The -i parameter tells Blitrix to invert the touchscreen coordinates, as
their coordinate systems do not match those of the framebuffer device on
the Mistral board.

2. Run the Qt-version of the Blitrix demo with the following command:
	$ bxdemo_qt -qws

you need to make sure that the qt libraries are in the PATH. you can export the path with the following command
	$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/qt/libraries
